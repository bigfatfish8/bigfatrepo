    Welcome to artisan. This space has been created for creatives. Explore, share and inspire through the work of your peers.
    All mediums, styles and skill levels are welcome in this space. Small time and amature artist who dont have the confidence or space to share their work. Artisan will be a space where any kind of creator can share their work with fellow artists. People can share advice, find inspiration and cull the anxiety of imperfect art and immeasuable skill. 
    Searching for inspiration can be daunting. This site aims to inspire through other mediums, provoking original ideas and ending the feeling of forced creativity.
    Artisanâ€™s purpose will be to remedy this. Writers can search through illustrators and create a story about an image. Artists can read a poem and then create it visually. Inspirartion for imposters.
